# SWE_NetworkingNight

This was created for the UT Austin's Society of Women Engineers (SWE) chapter's annual Networking Night Dinner, where about 18 companies and over 120 students participate. This night is an opportunitiy for students to network with companies of their choosing. Each company is given a table for each session (Entree and Dessert), where up to 7 students can sit at. 
Students are asked to fill out a form which requests their name, major, year, and 5 companies they would like to choose. From here, this code matches students to companies based on their choosing and availability, otherwise, it will assign them to a company based on the company's interest in their major.
