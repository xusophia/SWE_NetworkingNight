# For each student: Grab five preferences and make it into a list to find the 2 combinations that work

# Once you have the 2 combinations that work, put Last Name, First Name, EID, Major, Year, Email and the 2 combinations
# that work into a dataframe
# LastName  FirstName   EID     Major   Year    Email   Entree  Dessert

# Put the successful matches into a dataframe
# I need to finish this later but I just realized that this has to be for each student. If you cannot find a successful
# (PERFECT) match for a student, you then need to do the force match section
